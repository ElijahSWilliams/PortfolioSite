        I’m Elijah, a developer passionate about crafting accessible,
        user-friendly interfaces that blend thoughtful design with solid
        engineering. I thrive at the intersection of creativity and logic —
        where layout decisions meet clean, maintainable code, and every pixel
        has a purpose. My focus is on JavaScript, React, and modern web
        development practices that prioritize performance, usability, and
        accessibility. Whether I’m building dynamic UIs, integrating APIs, or
        refining the details that make an interface feel just right, I aim to
        create experiences that are both functional and delightful. I’ve worked
        on a variety of projects — from landing pages and interactive components
        to full web apps — using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and
        Node.js). Each project has sharpened my ability to think like a
        full-stack developer and solve problems across the stack.
